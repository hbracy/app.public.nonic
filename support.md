Last updated: October 1, 2025

We’re here to help you get the most out of NoNic. If you run into any issues, have questions, or want to share feedback, use the resources below.

### Contact us
- Email: hbracy1@gmail.com <!-- Replace with your support mailbox -->
- Response time: We aim to reply within 1–2 business days (Mon–Fri, excluding holidays).

If you’re experiencing a crash or bug, please include:
- Your device model (e.g., iPhone 14)
- iOS version (Settings → General → About)
- App version (open the app → Home → look for version at the bottom if available)
- Steps to reproduce the issue and screenshots if possible

### Restore purchases (iOS)
If you’ve previously purchased a subscription or one-time unlock and need to restore it:
1. Open NoNic on the same Apple ID you used for the purchase.
2. Navigate to the paywall or subscription screen.
3. Tap “Restore Purchases”.
4. Wait a few moments for confirmation. If it doesn’t complete, ensure you have internet access and try again.

Notes:
- You must be signed in with the same Apple ID used for the original purchase.
- If you still can’t restore, restart your device and try again, then contact us with your Apple receipt if available.

### Manage subscription or request a refund
- Manage or cancel your subscription via Apple: [Manage your subscriptions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039)

### Data and privacy
We take your privacy seriously.
- Privacy Policy: [PRIVACY_POLICY.md](./privacy.md)
- Terms of Use: [TERMS_OF_USE.md](./terms.md)

Data storage:
- NoNic does not require an account. Your app data is stored locally on your device unless otherwise stated.
- To remove local data, you can uninstall the app. Some settings may persist in system backups; restoring from a backup can restore prior state.

Data deletion:
- Because data is stored locally, deleting the app removes app data from your device. If a future version offers cloud sync, we’ll add an in‑app option to request deletion.

### Troubleshooting
- App won’t open or is unresponsive:
  - Force close the app and reopen.
  - Restart your device.
  - Ensure you’re on the latest version of iOS and the app.
- Content not updating or progress stuck:
  - Check your internet connection if network content is involved.
  - Sign out/in of your Apple ID (rarely necessary) and retry Restore Purchases if applicable.
- In‑app purchase charged but features locked:
  - Use “Restore Purchases.”
  - If still locked, contact us with your Apple receipt and approximate purchase time.

### Accessibility
We strive to support system accessibility features (Dynamic Type, VoiceOver). If you encounter barriers, please contact us with details so we can improve.

### Supported platforms
- iOS: iPhone and iPad running iOS/iPadOS 15.0 or later (recommended)
- Network: An internet connection may be required for certain features

## NoNic Terms of Use

Effective date: September 30, 2025

These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the NoNic mobile application and related services (collectively, the "Services"). By using the Services, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

If you have questions, contact us at [your contact email].

## 1. About NoNic (Not Medical Advice)
NoNic provides wellness and habit-support content to help users reduce or quit nicotine. NoNic does not provide medical advice and is not a substitute for professional medical care, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of a qualified healthcare provider for questions about a medical condition. If you experience a medical emergency, call your local emergency number immediately.

## 2. Eligibility
You must be at least 13 years old (or the age of digital consent in your jurisdiction, 16 in the EEA/UK) to use the Services. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may use the Services only with involvement of a parent or legal guardian.

## 3. Your Account
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must promptly notify us of any unauthorized access or suspected breach of security.

## 4. License and Acceptable Use
Subject to your compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the Services for your personal, non-commercial use.

You agree not to:
- Copy, modify, distribute, sell, lease, or sublicense the Services or any content except as expressly permitted
- Reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code, except where permitted by law
- Access or use the Services in a manner that could interfere with, disrupt, or negatively affect other users or the operation of the Services
- Upload, transmit, or distribute content that is unlawful, harmful, defamatory, harassing, infringing, or otherwise objectionable
- Use any automated means (e.g., bots, scrapers) without our prior written consent

## 5. User Content
You may submit information such as logs, entries, notes, and preferences ("User Content"). You retain ownership of your User Content. By submitting User Content, you grant NoNic a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, and display such content solely to operate and improve the Services. You represent that you have the rights necessary to grant this license and that your User Content complies with these Terms and applicable laws.

## 6. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions
Some features may require payment of fees, including subscriptions. Purchases made through the Apple App Store or Google Play are processed by those platforms and are subject to their terms and policies. Subscription terms, pricing, free trials, renewal, and cancellation are presented at purchase. Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current period, subscriptions automatically renew at the then-current price. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your app store account settings.

All fees are non-refundable except where required by law. We may offer promotional trials or discounts; eligibility and duration are at our discretion and may be modified or terminated at any time.

## 7. Privacy
Your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect, use, and share information. Please review the Privacy Policy carefully.

## 8. Third-Party Services
The Services may integrate with or link to third-party services. Your use of those services is governed by their terms, not ours. We are not responsible for third-party content, policies, or practices.

## 9. Intellectual Property
The Services, including software, text, graphics, images, logos, and other materials, are owned by or licensed to NoNic and are protected by intellectual property laws. Except for the license granted in Section 4, no rights are granted to you.

## 10. Feedback
If you provide feedback, suggestions, or ideas about the Services ("Feedback"), you grant NoNic a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free license to use the Feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.

## 11. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time, with or without notice, including if we believe you have violated these Terms or pose a risk. Upon termination, your right to use the Services will cease. Sections that by their nature should survive termination shall survive (including, without limitation, Sections 5, 9, 10, 12–16).

## 12. Disclaimers
THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE.

## 13. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NONIC AND ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICES IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM; OR (B) USD $50.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages, so some of the above may not apply to you.

## 14. Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless NoNic and its affiliates, officers, employees, agents, and licensors from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your use of the Services, your User Content, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

## 15. Changes to the Services or Terms
We may modify or discontinue all or part of the Services at any time. We may also update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the "Effective date" above and may provide additional notice as required by law. Your continued use of the Services after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 16. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of [your governing jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of laws principles. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in [your venue] for any disputes that are not subject to arbitration.

Where permitted by law, you and NoNic agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration on an individual basis, and not as a class or collective action. If arbitration is not permitted for a particular claim, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts identified above. Details of any arbitration procedure will be provided if and when applicable.

## 17. Export and Sanctions Compliance
You may not use or access the Services if you are located in a jurisdiction subject to comprehensive sanctions or if you are on a U.S. or other applicable government restricted party list.
